<button class="collapsible">1. Is a Javascript Array Mutable? array methods filter, indexOf, at, splice and slice</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> In Javascript, Arrays are mutable. The Filter method allows you to make a copy of the array with a predetermined filter, such as length > 6. indexOf provides the location of an item in the array. Slice allows you to create a new array from a section of another, and splice lets you add or remove items in a predefined array. </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">2. Explain javascript array methods: push, pop, shift and unshift.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> The push method allows you to append a new item to the end of an array, pop removes the last element of an array and returns it. shift and unshift both do similar things, adding an element at a specific location in an array and either upshifting or downshifting the rest of the array to fit the new method. </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">3. Name two differences between netlify and back4APP, and provide 3 alternatives and competitors to them.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>back4APP is a platform that allows you to use a cloud based relational database management system, that provides API support. Netlify is a service that allows you to deploy serverless backend support for websites, not excluding rdbms. Three competitiors to these companies are Vultr, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">4. In CSS, what is a compound selector, what is an attribute selector. Provide 8 Selectors to use in web applications.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>A compound selector is a set of selectors that all apply to a single element on a page. Whereas an attribute selector only applies to elements on a page with an attribute equal to that element. :active, ::after, ::before, :checked, :default, :empty ,:enabled and :focus are all selectors that can be used.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">5. Briefly compare json, xml, yaml, and markdown</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>JSON is a dataformat that allows you to store javascript objects directly in a plaintext document. XML is a markup language that provides rules to define data in a similar way, storing data in a format that can be taken apart later. YAML is similar to both XML and JSON, storing data in a slightly different format. Markdown Language is used to configure formatted text with a plain text editor, it is most commonly used to format readme documents on github pages.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">6. Name two js libraries and two js framework respectively. </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Two popular javascript libraries are jquery and ajax. Two popular frameworks are React and Angular</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">7. Differentiate nextjs vs. meteorjs vs. expressjs </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Next.js is a React framework that focuses on server-rendered applications. This means that the application is rendered on the server before being sent to the client, which can improve performance and SEO. Next.js also supports static site generation, which can be useful for applications that do not need to be updated frequently.<br>

    Meteor.js is a full-stack framework that includes everything you need to build a web application, including a database, a web server, and a client-side framework. Meteor is known for its real-time capabilities, which allow for two-way communication between the server and the client.<br>
    
    Express.js is a microframework that provides a minimal set of features for building web applications. Express is a popular choice for developers who want to have more control over the architecture of their application.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">8. Name 4 major differences between Angular vs. React </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Size and complexity: Angular is a larger and more complex framework than React. This means that it has more features, but it can also be more difficult to learn and use.<br>
    Data binding: Angular uses two-way data binding, while React uses one-way data binding. This means that in Angular, changes to the data in the model are automatically reflected in the view, and vice versa. In React, changes to the data in the model must be explicitly propagated to the view.<br>
    DOM manipulation: Angular uses the real DOM, while React uses a virtual DOM. This means that Angular updates the real DOM directly, while React updates a virtual DOM in memory and then compares the virtual DOM to the real DOM to determine what changes need to be made. This can lead to better performance in React, especially for large applications.<br>
    Community: Angular has a larger and more active community than React. This means that there are more resources available for Angular developers, such as tutorials and documentation</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">9. The primary function of a JS build tool is to combine multiple JavaScript files into one single file or bundle that can be used in the browser to load your application. This file or JavaScript bundle contains all our code and the third-party dependencies that are imported and used in the code.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Js Built tools also lint, compress and test javascript code, all to tidy it up and make it smaller for deployment. Saving time when using the code later</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">10. Provide 2 Examples of a task-runner</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Grunt is a task runner that runs tasks using Node.js. Grunt tasks are defined in a configuration file, and can be run using the grunt command. Grunt is a popular task runner, and there are many plugins available for it.<br>
    Gulp is another task runner that runs tasks using Node.js. Gulp tasks are defined in a configuration file, and can be run using the gulp command. Gulp is a newer task runner than Grunt, and it is known for its speed and efficiency.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">11. Explain npm, npx, package,json and package-lock.json</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    npm is a package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install, update, and manage Node.js packages. npm also provides a registry of packages that you can use.<br>
    
    npx is a tool that allows you to run Node.js packages without installing them. This is useful for running one-off commands or testing packages.<br>
    
    nvm is a tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js. This is useful if you need to use different versions of Node.js for different projects.<br>
    
    package.json is a file that contains information about a Node.js project. This includes the project's name, version, dependencies, and scripts.<br>
    
    package-lock.json is a file that is generated by npm when you install packages. It contains the exact versions of the packages that were installed. This is useful for ensuring that your project always uses the same versions of the packages, even if the versions change in the registry.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">12. Explain the differences between CSS, LESS and SASS</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
    CSS is a declarative language, which means that you specify the desired presentation of an element, rather than how to achieve it.<br>

    LESS stands for Leaner CSS. It is a CSS preprocessor that adds features to CSS, such as variables, mixins, and functions.
    LESS is a superset of CSS, which means that any valid CSS is also valid LESS.
    LESS is compiled to CSS, so it can be used with any CSS-capable browser.<br>

    SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets. It is another CSS preprocessor that adds features similar to LESS.
    SASS is compiled to CSS, so it can be used with any CSS-capable browser.
    SASS has a different syntax than CSS, so it is not a strict superset of CSS.<br>

<button class="collapsible">14. Explain Media Queries and viewport and grid layout.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Media queries are a CSS feature that allows you to specify different styles for different media types, such as screens, printers, and mobile devices. Media queries are used to create responsive web designs, which are designs that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.<br>
    
    The viewport is the visible area of a web page. The viewport size can change depending on the size of the screen, the zoom level, and the orientation of the device.<br>

    Grid layout is a CSS layout method that allows you to create a grid of elements. Grid layout is a powerful tool that can be used to create complex and responsive layouts.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">15. Explain Data-attributes</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Data attributes can be used to store any type of data, such as:
    
    Information about the element, such as its id or class.
    Data that is used by JavaScript code.
    Data that is sent to the server.
    Data attributes are a powerful tool that can be used to add extra functionality to HTML elements. They are easy to use and they are supported by all major browsers.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">16. Briefly Descirbe 4 Popular Template Engines</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Pug (formerly Jade): Pug is a high-performance template engine that is known for its terse syntax and its ability to produce clean, semantic HTML.<br>
    EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS is a template engine that is embedded in JavaScript. It is easy to learn and use, and it is compatible with a wide range of frameworks.<br>
    Handlebars: Handlebars is a popular template engine that is known for its powerful features, such as its ability to create custom tags and filters.<br>

<div class="content">
  <p>POST - Used to create a new resource.<br>
    GET - Used to retrieve a resource.<br>
    PUT - Used to update a resource.<br>
    PATCH - Used to partially update a resource.<br>
    DELETE - Used to delete a resource.<br>
   Two other methods are OPTION and HEAD</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">19. vanilla JS, jquery vs. jqueryUI</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Vanilla javascript is the base JS language built into all web browsers. Jquery is a library that makes it easier to interact with the DOM. jqueryUI is a library that adds a set of widgets and effects to add common interfaces to a web document.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">20. What is same-origin policy?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    The same-origin policy is a security feature in web browsers that prevents a web page from accessing resources from a different origin. This helps to protect users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker could inject malicious code into a web page that could then be executed by the user's browser.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">21. Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Explain each of these three phases are about.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Mounting is the phase when a component is first created and inserted into the DOM. During this phase, React will call the component's constructor, render() method, and componentDidMount() method.<br>
    Updating is the phase when a component is updated. This can happen when the component's props or state change. During this phase, React will call the component's getDerivedStateFromProps() method, shouldComponentUpdate() method, render() method, and componentDidUpdate() method.<br>
    Unmounting is the phase when a component is removed from the DOM. During this phase, React will call the component's componentWillUnmount() method.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">22. Briefly explain the purpose of each of the following hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRefuse, Reducer, useCallback useMemo.</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The useState hook is used to manage state in a functional component. It takes two arguments: the initial state value and a function that is used to update the state. The useState hook returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function that is used to update the state.<br>
    The useEffect hook is used to run side effects in a functional component. It takes two arguments: a function that is executed when the component mounts and a function that is executed when the component updates. The useEffect hook is a powerful tool that can be used to do things like make AJAX requests, set up event listeners, and manage subscriptions.<br>
    The useContext hook is used to access context values in a functional component. It takes one argument: the context object. The useContext hook returns the current value of the context.<br>
    The useRef hook is used to create a mutable ref in a functional component. It takes one argument: the initial value of the ref. The useRef hook returns a ref object that can be used to get and set the value of the ref.<br>
    The useReducer hook is used to manage state in a functional component using a reducer function. It takes three arguments: the initial state value, the reducer function, and an array of arguments that are passed to the reducer function. The useReducer hook returns an array with two values: the current state value and a function that is used to update the state.<br>
    The useCallback hook is used to create a memoized callback in a functional component. It takes two arguments: the callback function and an array of dependencies. The useCallback hook returns a memoized callback that will only be re-created when the dependencies change.<br>
    The useMemo hook is used to create a memoized value in a functional component. It takes two arguments: a function that returns the value and an array of dependencies. The useMemo hook returns a memoized value that will only be re-computed when the dependencies change.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">23. React components, state, props, jsx, rxjs, virtual DOM</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    State is data that is stored inside a React component. It can be changed by the component's code, and it will be reflected in the component's UI.<br>
    Props are data that is passed to a React component from its parent component. They can be used to customize the component's behavior and appearance.<br>
    JSX is a special syntax for describing the UI of an application. It is similar to HTML, but it can be used to create more complex and dynamic UIs.<br>
    RxJS is a library for reactive programming. It can be used to handle asynchronous events and data streams in React applications.<br>
    Virtual DOM is a way of representing the UI of an application in memory. It is used by React to efficiently update the UI when the state or props of a component change.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">24. What is EJSON?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    EJSON stands for Encrypted JSON. It is a format for storing JSON data that has been encrypted using public-key cryptography. EJSON is used by Meteor, a platform for building real-time web applications.
    
    EJSON files are stored in a format that is similar to JSON, but the values are encrypted using the public key of the user who created the file. When the file is read, the private key is used to decrypt the values.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">25. Provide answers for the following concepts: client-server application, socket programming, ip address, tcp port, http</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Client-server application is a type of application that consists of two parts: a client and a server. The client is the part of the application that sends requests to the server, and the server is the part of the application that receives requests from the client and sends back responses.<br>
    Socket programming is a way of creating client-server applications. It allows applications to communicate with each other over a network using a socket. A socket is an endpoint for communication between two processes.<br>
    IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network. It is a 32-bit number that is divided into four parts, separated by periods. For example, the IP address of Google's homepage is 172.217.14.192.<br>
    TCP port is a number that is associated with a specific service on a computer. For example, the port number for HTTP is 80. When a client connects to a server, it specifies the port number that it wants to connect to.<br>
    HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer hypertext documents over the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web. HTTP is a request-response protocol. The client sends a request to the server, and the server sends back a response.
